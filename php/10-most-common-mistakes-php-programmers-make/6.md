* PHP 5 is not unicode-aware (PHP 6 is but development stalled in 2010)
* Not all strings are "plain old ASCII"!

Checklist:
* If you don’t know much about Unicode and UTF-8, you should at least learn the basics. There’s a great primer here: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html.
* Be sure to always use the mb_* functions instead of the old string functions (make sure the “multibyte” extension is included in your PHP build).
* Make sure your database and tables are set to use Unicode (many builds of MySQL still use latin1 by default).
* Remember that json_encode() converts non-ASCII symbols (e.g., “Schrödinger” becomes “Schr\u00f6dinger”) but serialize() does not.
* Make sure your PHP code files are also UTF-8 encoded to avoid collisions when concatenating strings with hardcoded or configured string constants.
