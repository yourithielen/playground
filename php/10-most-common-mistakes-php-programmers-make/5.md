When we consider both this mistake and mistake #4 above, we realize that there is a healthy balance that your code
ideally needs to achieve between, on the one hand, having your queries being too granular and repetitive, vs.
having each of your individual queries be too large. As is true with most things in life, balance is needed; either
extreme is not good and can cause problems.
